Your Original Code Mistake          The Corrected Approach and Why It Works
min-w-full on children              Replaced with w-full and flex-shrink-0. This combination forces the element to take up the full width and prevents it from shrinking.
Using overflow-scroll               Used overflow-x-scroll for a more specific and clearer intent.
No flex-shrink property             Added flex-shrink-0 to explicitly prevent the flex items from shrinking, which is necessary for the horizontal scrolling behavior.
Justify-center in parent            When you use justify-center on a flex container, it attempts to align its children along the main axis (horizontally, in this case). However, since your child elements each have w-full, they already occupy 100% of the parent's width. There's no extra space to center them within, so this rule is effectively ignored for visual alignment. It can also interfere with the browser's rendering of the overflow.

Placing content divs directly next to each other with no separation	Added justify-center and a small margin (ml-8) to center the content within each slide and provide visual separation.
